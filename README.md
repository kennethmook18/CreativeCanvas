# CreativeCanvas
A program that enables you to draw a wide array of shapes including, and simply create. The program is a GUI and is done completely in java. The shapes should all go in their own package which I named shapes and the Grid.java, Painting.java, and CreativeCanvas.java in another which I named painting. Together both packages should be in its own project.

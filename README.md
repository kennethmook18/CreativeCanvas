# CreativeCanvas
A program that enables you to draw a wide array of shapes and simply create. The program is a GUI and is done completely in java. The shapes should all go in their own package which I named shapes and the Grid.java, Painting.java, and CreativeCanvas.java in another package which I named painting. Together both packages should be in its own project. 

Program Functionality:

- Save and Save As store the information from the shapes on the screen in a text file in the current directory that can be       opened later. 
- Open allows you to select a file and then draws the shapes whose information are stored in the file onthe canvas.
- Clear Screen removes all shapes from the canvas.
- Fill toggles whether or not the shapes being drawn are filled in.
- Grid toggles the gridlines and pixel labels.
- Edit Color allows you to select the color the shapes will be drawn in.
- Selecting a different shape in the draw menu changes the type of shape you are drawing.
- Draw lines, ellipses, and rectangles by dragging and releasing the mouse.
- Draw curves by freeform dragging across the canvas.
- Draw polygons by clicking the points that you want to connect and then pressing enter when you're done.
- To select shapes to cut or copy, choose select in the edit menu and drag to select shapes.
- Once you have selected shapes you can cut or copy them using the commands in the edit menu.
- Paste repaints the last shape(s) that was cut or copied in the same location that it was in.
- Undo removes the last shape drawn, redo repaints the last shape that was undone.
- The hot keys to open up the menu are Alt-F for File, Alt-D for Draw, Alt-E for Edit, and Alt-H for Help.
- Some hotkeys for specific actions only work if the menu that the functions are in is open (includes f for Fill, g for Grid,   c for Edit Color).
